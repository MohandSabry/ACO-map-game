**Interactive Ant Colony TSP Learning Tool**

This project provides an interactive, browser-based environment for exploring the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) metaheuristic. Developed in Python using Streamlit, the tool enables users to construct TSP routes manually and compare them with solutions generated by an ACO algorithm. The interface emphasizes visual understanding, algorithmic behavior, and hands-on experimentation.

1. Features

Click-Based Route Construction
	•	Users select labeled cities (A, B, C, …) to build a route sequentially.
	•	A directional polyline is drawn as cities are chosen.
	•	Upon selecting all cities, the route closes automatically.
	•	The total route length is computed and updated immediately.

Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) Solver

A full implementation of ACO for TSP is included, featuring:
	•	Pheromone matrix representation
	•	Distance-based heuristic (1 / distance)
	•	Probabilistic transition rule for selecting the next city
	•	Pheromone evaporation and reinforcement
	•	Tracking of the best route and best distance across iterations

Route Animations
	•	Step-by-step animation of the user-defined route
	•	Step-by-step animation of the best route discovered by ACO
	•	Directional markers indicate traversal order

Performance Visualization
	•	A line chart illustrates improvement in the best ACO route over iterations.

Educational Explanations

Built-in descriptions clarify:
	•	How ants select routes using pheromone and heuristic information
	•	The role of α (pheromone weight), β (heuristic weight), Q, and evaporation
	•	How pheromone updates influence search dynamics

3. How the Tool Works

Step 1 — City Generation

Randomly positioned cities are generated on a 2D plane and labeled.

Step 2 — User-Defined Route Construction

Users select cities in order:
	•	Each selection extends the displayed route
	•	Arrowheads indicate direction
	•	The route closes when all cities have been chosen
	•	The route length is computed and displayed

Step 3 — Running the ACO Algorithm

Configurable parameters include:
	•	Number of ants
	•	Number of iterations
	•	α (pheromone weight)
	•	β (distance weight)
	•	Evaporation rate
	•	Pheromone reinforcement factor Q

Algorithm behavior:
	1.	Each ant constructs a route probabilistically
	2.	Shorter routes produce stronger pheromone updates
	3.	Older pheromone evaporates
	4.	Global best route is updated across iterations
	5.	The algorithm gradually converges toward an improved solution

Step 4 — Comparison and Visualization

The interface displays:
	•	ACO’s best route (orange)
	•	User’s route (blue)
	•	Percentage difference in route length
	•	Animation of either route
	•	A chart showing ACO performance over time

6. Ant Colony Optimization: Algorithm Overview

Desirability Function

For an ant located at city i, the desirability of moving to city j is:

\text{desirability}_j = (\tau_{ij})^{\alpha} \left(\frac{1}{d_{ij}}\right)^{\beta}

Higher pheromone levels (τ) and shorter distances (d) increase the likelihood of selection.

Transition Probability

Desirability values are normalized:

p_j = \frac{\text{desirability}_j}{\sum_k \text{desirability}_k}

Pheromone Update

After each iteration:

Evaporation:
\tau_{ij} \leftarrow (1 - \rho)\tau_{ij}

Deposition:
\Delta \tau_{ij} = \frac{Q}{\text{route length}}

Shorter tours deposit stronger pheromone reinforcement.

7. Future Extensions
	•	Direct map clicking instead of button-based input
	•	Visualization of pheromone intensities on edges
	•	Real-time ant movement animations
	•	Predefined city layouts (grid, circle, clusters)
	•	Support for additional ACO variants (ACS, MMAS)
